            In the void the eternal creatures squirmed and writhed in a ceaseless mass with 
            little to no room between each other. There was no conflict until one of the ceaseless 
            chaoses wanted space and slew another. The blood of the beast spread rapidly and as 
            it did the bodies of the eternals drifted apart. The void was no longer empty and packed 
            with entities, it was now flooded with elemental chaos. The swirting chaos coalesced into 
            into the elements fire, earth, life, water, metal, light, wind, and void. These elements 
            began to draw together, the elements that were unable to coalesce continued to swirl mixed 
            together on the outskirts of the elemental plains.
